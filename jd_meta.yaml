# Decision thresholds

thresholds:

  advance: 0.72  # score >= 0.72 AND all must-haves present (strong match)

  review: 0.50   # score >= 0.50 (potential with some gaps)

  # Below 0.50 = reject (significant gaps)



# Additional context for scoring

notes: |

  Key responsibilities:

  - Short-circuit analysis & breaker-duty studies

  - CAPE/ASPEN software proficiency required

  - Protection schemes design for transmission interconnections

  - Customer communication & technical expertise

  - Renewable energy (solar) focus

  

  Red flags to watch for:

  - No CAPE or ASPEN experience

  - Less than 4 years experience

  - No power systems background

  - Missing protection/short-circuit analysis experience
